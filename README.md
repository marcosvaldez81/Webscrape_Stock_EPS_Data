# Webscrape_Stock_EPS_Data

I am active in the markets and investing world. One thing I always look at when investing in a company is its stock EPS data. Manually searching every ticker just was tiresome. So I decided to automate the task.

This script will take a passed in ticker in the function, and print a clean output of the eps history from past year and some change.
